# friend-finder
This is my first Bootcamp assignment that is would be considered Full Stack. The assignment was to create a friend finder application that would match the answers of 10 questions with the answers of the of another user and provide a closest match. I threw in a few celebrities just to give some starter info. 

The application uses Node.js, Express.js, and a npm package manager called body parser to ease communication beween the front and the back end.
