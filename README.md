# friend-finder
This is my first Bootcamp assignment that is would be considered Full Stack. The assignment was to create a friend finder application that would match the answers of 10 questions with the answers of the answers of another and provide a closest match. I have decided to change it a little bit to match with recent presidents.

The application uses Node.js, Express.js, and a npm package manager called body parser to ease communication beween the front and the back end.
